# About
This extension makes it easy to insert Lorem... text into a field when you right-click on it.

The extension adds a context menu option called "Lorem Fill" when you right-click on a `TEXTAREA` or `INPUT[type=text]` element.
If the element has a `maxlength` attribute, the extension will honor it.
